            <p>Hey, this is Jared I was born and raised in Bolivia, and in 2019 I went to the Brazil where I spent two years learning English and Portuguese as well as gaining valuable experience in customer-facing roles. In 2021 I returned to Bolivia where I am focusing on my passion for technology. 
               I enjoy swimming, basketball, reading, volley ball, and skate, I am one of four children and returned from my mission in Brazil like 2 years ago, now Im married and waiting for our first doughter. I hope to be a Full stack Web developer working for a company in Bolivia, Jala Soft, or for another one in USA remotely, as I told you I'm married and I have been working as a Virtual Assistant for a company in USA for 2 years, this Job helped me to improve my English skills and computer skills, that is a reason to look for a remote Job from Bolivia in USA.

            <p>Cochabamba is a department of beautiful and fertile valleys located between the Eastern Andes mountain range, which has an unmatched Mediterranean climate. That is why the central valley of Cochabamba is known as the region of eternal spring, very appropriate for rest, health and recreation.</p>
